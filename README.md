BDD IS AWESOME! LET'S DO IT FOR EVERYTHING!

The first rainbow of effort went so well that the team decided to try doing a new feature using that approach.

This new feature has cucumber scenarios covering it, and unit tests for it, and everyone is feeling good about the coverage of this new fearture.  

One thing that the team noticed is that the existing codebase is still largely uncovered with tests, and sometimes they had trouble with understanding what was going on in some of the previous legacy code, or there was something acting unexpectedly and with the way the code is designed, it was tricky to track down exactly what was going on.  While the shiny new is fun and works well, the stink of the old poorly designed code hangs over the team like smog ... everyone knows that should be addressed soon as well.

While higher level acceptance tests are great for quick wins and progress that show the team and those outside the team test coverage and status, the legacy codebase is still lacking in unit tests.  The coverage can only go so far, and many detailed combinations of test cases should not be coverd here.  The existing features are still left a little naked and new development of features is still pretty risky without these lower level tests.
