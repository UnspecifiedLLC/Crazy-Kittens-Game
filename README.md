Okay, I am only so creative, so now let's talk in terms that are less fantasy :)

You team has spent one rainbow of effort on trying to begin using unti tests. Few people on the team had much experience with unit tests before. They have researched, discussed, and picked a framework, and gotten that framework working with the existing codebase.  This takes time, of course, and there is a learning curve.

A few units tests have been written, but it feels like not much was done that is visible to the business owners during that time. They have a hard time seeing the benefits of these lower level tests. They are feeling antsy and want to see more results, sooner.  Rainbows are expensive, ya know ...

While learning about unit tests and writing the first ones, the team has discovered that the design of the software isn't super great, and won't scale well over time.  There are functions that are large and do a LOT of things, violating many modern programming practices.  The unit tests on these functions, as a result, cover a few different features.  This design will be confusing and tricky to maintain over time.  These functions should probably be refactored for better design. There is recognition across the team that this is part of what is helpful about unit testing and driving their development with tests, but what is the best way to spend the next rainbow of effort?
