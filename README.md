## Crazy Kittens : Page 0 Chapter 1


#### Once upon a time a funny story was written for STARWest and YOU were put in charge. 

#### Will you survive or will you die of dysentery?
*******

You wake up slowly ... it's dark in this room. You don't know where you are or remember how you got there.  It's damp, the air hangs around your skin, not moving. The first thing you think of is a dungeon, like in those movies set during the Medieval Period. 

You blink hard and wake a little more, and realize that you can hear sounds ... quiet, low, almost rumbly sounds.  Is that the purr of a cat?  As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you realize that you can see movement ... like the whole floor is moving ... snakes?

You feel a scratch on your arm and you quickly recoil.  What in the-- IT'S A CAT!  Suddenly you realize that the whole room is filled with them, below the hard wooden bench that you are sitting on.

Next to you on the bench are two milk crates. Both are labeled. The one closest to you says "Harness from the top". In this crate, there are a bunch of nets with weights around the edges. The label on the other crate says "Start with Maslow". In this crate is a bag of cat food and a jug of water.

You have to get out of this room, or at least try.  Will you try to herd these cats from above, trapping them in nets, or satisfy their needs on a lower level, and hope they will work with you?

If you choose to spend one rainbow of effort on "Harness from the top" (aka Acceptance level tests): [turn to page 42](../page-42/README.md)
